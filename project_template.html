          <h2>Dynamic Lifeline</h2>
          <p>Costa Rica's tropical rainforests have faced severe destruction due to deforestation, agriculture, ranching, and urbanization, causing significant habitat loss for wildlife. Sloths, as slow-moving arboreal animals, are particularly at risk due to their reliance on a continuous canopy. This project aims to create safe migration paths for sloths across cities, farmland, and fragmented rainforests by proposing tailored strategies that address specific threats while harmonizing with the environment. These interventions gradually reduce human impact, supporting sloths in safely migrating and returning to nature.</p>

                The project is a design proposal for sloths to cross three types of land: city, farmland, and
