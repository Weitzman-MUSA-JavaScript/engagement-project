            <h1>About this tool</h1>
            <p>Clear Paths Philadelphia is a tool that helps pedestrians find
                easier and safer routes to their destination. When providing a route,
                the app uses open data to identify areas that may be unfriendly
                to pedestrians. Some considerations include whether it's trash day, if
                there are a lot of instances of cars parked on sidewalks or crosswalks,
                sidewalk width, curb ramps, and Walk Score.
            </p>
            <p>Another vital part of the app's success is user-generated reports. Users
                can report violations or events that impede upon walkability or accessibility.
                These reports improve the route generated by the app by supplementing
                the various data sources with real-time information.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone deserves a smooth journey, no matter how they travel. Obstructions
                make the pedestrian experience more difficult and dangerous for everybody,
                but individuals with impaired vision or restricted mobility are most affected
                by this issue. By prioritizing the needs of these groups in our app,
                Clear Paths Philadelphia contributes to the larger goal
                of making our travel options more equitable and accessible for all.
