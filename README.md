# Project Description

This project showcases the site locations, serving hours, and contact information of the DC Summer Meal Program. It is designed to help both providers and beneficiaries access relevant information easily and interact efficiently:

 - For Providers: Program providers can log in to publish updates or announcements directly on the platform.
 - For Beneficiaries: Beneficiaries can browse all available information without needing to log in. They can also anonymously leave comments or feedback and read reviews left by others.

# Purpose of the Project

The DC Summer Meal Program plays a critical role in addressing food insecurity by providing free meals to children during the summer. This project enhances accessibility by centralizing meal program information, making it easier for families in need to locate resources quickly. Additionally, the anonymous comment feature encourages users to share their experiences and suggestions without fear of judgment, fostering community engagement and improving the program's outreach.
